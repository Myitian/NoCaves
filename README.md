# NoCaves
Disables Noise Caves, Density Function Caves, Carver Caves, and Carver Canyons based on the configuration, and maintains compatibility with other terrain modification mods and data packs as much as possible. Affects all biomes and all worldgen JSON based world presets.

This project is in early development and is subject to change in future versions. The current target version of Minecraft is 1.20.6, which is between 1.20.x and 1.21.x versions to facilitate future migrations.

根据配置禁用噪声洞穴、密度函数洞穴、雕刻器洞穴和雕刻器峡谷，并尽可能保持与其他地形修改模组和数据包的兼容性。影响所有生物群系和所有基于 JSON 的世界生成预设。

该项目处于早期开发阶段，当前目标 Minecraft 版本为 1.20.6，介于 1.20.x 和 1.21.x 版本之间，以方便将来迁移。
